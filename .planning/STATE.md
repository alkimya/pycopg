## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Full async parity over partial: Users expect same API surface in both sync and async (pending)
- Breaking changes allowed: Clean API more valuable than backwards compat at v0.3.0 (pending)
- Keep monolithic Database class: Restructuring is high risk/effort, not needed for consolidation (pending)
- Real PostgreSQL for tests: Mock-based tests don't catch real driver/DB interaction bugs (pending)
- Retry/backoff as only new feature: Scope control — consolidation release, not feature release (pending)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns
